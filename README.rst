RingPlus for Python
====================

Hopefully this will be a wrapper for the RingPlus API.

I don't have too much time to work on this.

I'll likely accept all pull request. Feel free to provide suggestions. I am
fairly busy, but hopefully I can get some time to finish everything in the
next few weeks.

I plan on adding tests, documentation, and providing better examples.

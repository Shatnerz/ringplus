RingPlus for Python
====================

Hopefully this will be a wrapper for the RingPlus API.

I don't have too much time to work on this.

I'll likely accept all pull request. Feel free to provide suggestions. I am
fairly busy, but hopefully I can get some time to finish everything in the
next few weeks.

I plan on adding tests, documentation, and providing better examples.

For now, check the examples directory to get a better understanding.


Installation
------------

I would install on editable mode in pip via

    git clone https://github.com/Shatnerz/ringplus.git

    cd ringplus

    pip install -e .

You can also install via

    pip install git+https://github.com/Shatnerz/ringplus.git
